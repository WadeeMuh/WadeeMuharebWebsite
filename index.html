        My name is Wadee' Muhareb, and I'm a Palestinian software developer. I graduated
        from Lakota East High School and the Butler Tech IT program and I'm currently a
        college freshman majoring in Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        My interest in the software development field can be traced back to when I was a
        kid who dreamt of being a game developer. I've studied programming since middle
        school where I used JavaScript to navigate a knight a dungeon. Since then,
        I've used languages such as Python, Java, C#, HTML, and CSS to create games,
        apps, and websites.
        <br><br>
        I love competing in game jams, working out, and listening to music!

<!--
        My name is Wadee' Muhareb. I'm a college freshman majoring in Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        My interest in the software development field began in middle school where I
        took my first programming oriented class where we used JavaScript to navigate
        a knight through a dungeon. In my sophomore year of high school, I took
        Computer Science Principles where I learned a little bit of Java and Python as
        I used them to create games and apps, and was introduced to computer science as
        a whole.
        <br><br>
        During the final two years of highschool, I attended the IT program at
        Butler Tech. There, I studied hardware, software, networking, and attained my
        Fortinet FCA certification. I didn't do much programming at Butler Tech until
        the summer break between my Junior year and my senior year when I started
        messing around with the Godot game engine.
        <br><br>
        Once my senior year began, I returned to Python and created an app that plays
        music files. I was later intrigued by the idea of competing in a Skills USA
        competition. Specifically, the "Interactive Application and Video Game
        Development" state competition. This was a competition where a team of two
        creates a game from November to March and competes against the other teams.
        I talked to one of my friends about it and we officially became a team. The
        main problem we faced was that neither of us really knew much about game
        development, so we dedicated the first month of the competition to learning
        the Godot game engine and GDScript which is the dedicated language for Godot.
        We both worked diligently on our game, "Discounts & Dragons", and although we
        didn't end up winning, we still learned valuable things about game
        development, working on a project in a team, and time management.
        <br><br>
        After the Skills USA competition, I realized how much I enjoyed game
        development and immediately joined another competition. If I wanted to get
        more into game development, I felt like the best thing for me to do between
        the end of my senior year and the start of college. This was a shorter
        competition held online on Itch.io that lasted a week. I didn't join with the
        expectation of winning. I just wanted to get better at game development. I
        created a game called "Hack & Slash" and submitted it.
        <br><br>
        I was planning on joining another competition afterwards but before I could,
        a friend of mine who has been starting a barbering business came to me asking
        if I could make him a website for his business. I was skeptical at first as
        I've never done anything with web development before up to this point and if
        I decided to do it, I'd only have
